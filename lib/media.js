				description: "<p>Great Scott! Can you believe Back to the Future came almost 40 years ago!? Neither can we. While most of us didn’t get to enjoy the classic films when they originally debuted, fans to this day are still discovering the thrilling, time travelling adventures of Doc and Marty. The famous DeLorean used in the trilogy has almost transcended the Back to the Future universe and become one of the most memorable movie props of all time. Doc and Marty famously speed the DeLorean up to 88mph and travel to 2015 in the second instalment of the films. I’m sure most of us would have preferred to live in their version of the future with actual hoverboards.</p><p>Needless to say, they were a bit off! While many of us still have some hope that one day we will get to experience a time-travelling car or a real hover-board, until then, we can pretend. Transport yourself back to the diner with some classic 80s merchandise. Retro is making a comeback and how better to display your fandom and love for Back to the Future than a <b>classic graphic t-shirt</b> or <b>replica DeLorean</b>.</p>"

				description: "The 1979 Ridley Scott epic has become a cult classic with fans of all genres and ages, even the ones that were not lucky enough to experience the original when it was released. The chilling filmmaking, design and of course, Alien, left fans unable to sleep. Many credit the Alien franchise with innovating on classic horror films and welcoming in the new modern horror genre that is loved today. “In space no-one can hear you scream…” is the line that was plastered around on the famous Alien posters and along with the ominous Alien sound, is the phrase that still sends shivers down many a fans spine to this day. The extra-terrestrial masterpiece has seen recent iterations with Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, introducing fans to the franchise.

We shared in the teenage angst, magnificent mythical creatures and sprawling other-worldly landscapes created from the wonderful mind of J.K Rowling.
