				description: "<p>Great Scott! Can you believe Back to the Future came almost 40 years ago!? Neither can we. While most of us didn’t get to enjoy the classic films when they originally debuted, fans to this day are still discovering the thrilling, time travelling adventures of Doc and Marty. The famous DeLorean used in the trilogy has almost transcended the Back to the Future universe and become one of the most memorable movie props of all time. Doc and Marty famously speed the DeLorean up to 88mph and travel to 2015 in the second instalment of the films. I’m sure most of us would have preferred to live in their version of the future with actual hoverboards.</p><p>Needless to say, they were a bit off! While many of us still have some hope that one day we will get to experience a time-travelling car or a real hover-board, until then, we can pretend. Transport yourself back to the diner with some classic 80s merchandise. Retro is making a comeback and how better to display your fandom and love for Back to the Future than a <b>classic graphic t-shirt</b> or <b>replica DeLorean</b>.</p>"

Who would have thought that George Lucas’s ambitious 1977 sci-fi thriller would now be considered one of the greatest films franchises ever made. While debates still rage on about which trilogy is best, original, sequels or prequels, all fans can agree that the characters that inhabit the Star Wars universe are extraordinary.</p><p>From villains that kept us awake at night like Darth Vader and and General Grievous, to protagonists that warm our hearts such as R2-D2, Chewbacca, C-3PO and Yoda. The newest sequel trilogy introduced a flurry of new characters like Finn, Kylo Ren and Rey, that captured our childlike wonder, allowing us to fall in love with the Star Wars universe all over again.

While we all still harbour that hope that we’ll receive our letter from Hogwarts in the mail (it probably got lost), fans around the world can’t help but be captivated by the timeless magic.</p><p>We joined Harry, Ron and Hermione on their epic adventures for 8 films, and still wanted more. We shared in the teenage angst, magnificent mythical creatures and sprawling other-worldly landscapes created from the wonderful mind of J.K Rowling. But, it’s the film's small features that were so important to its enchantment and that have translated best into merchandise. In fact, there is so much merchandise, collectibles and replicas that Gringotts vault would do well to hold it all! <b>Chocolate Frogs</b>, <b>Butterbeer</b>, <b>sweets</b>, <b>scarves</b> and <b>jewellery</b> are just some of the exact replicas that fans can own.</p><p>The only question left to ask is, what house do you belong in?</p>"

Even knowing how badly the experiment went with the small issue of escaped dinosaurs, we would all definitely visit the park if we had the chance. The classic Jurassic Park films created by Steven Spielberg in the early 90s will go down in cinema history as the epitome of the ‘edge of your seat’ thriller genre with unbelievable special effects, scenery and, of course, realistic dinosaurs.</p><p>Whether you’re an old-school fan of the original films or have just fallen in love with the franchise via the newest Jurassic World instalments, you’ll definitely be excited for Jurassic World Dominion, coming to theatres in 2021.
