				description: "<p>Great Scott! Can you believe Back to the Future came almost 40 years ago!? Neither can we. While most of us didn’t get to enjoy the classic films when they originally debuted, fans to this day are still discovering the thrilling, time travelling adventures of Doc and Marty. The famous DeLorean used in the trilogy has almost transcended the Back to the Future universe and become one of the most memorable movie props of all time. Doc and Marty famously speed the DeLorean up to 88mph and travel to 2015 in the second instalment of the films. I’m sure most of us would have preferred to live in their version of the future with actual hoverboards.</p><p>Needless to say, they were a bit off! While many of us still have some hope that one day we will get to experience a time-travelling car or a real hover-board, until then, we can pretend. Transport yourself back to the diner with some classic 80s merchandise. Retro is making a comeback and how better to display your fandom and love for Back to the Future than a <b>classic graphic t-shirt</b> or <b>replica DeLorean</b>.</p>"

Fans fell in love with unlikely heroes, Samwise and Frodo, as they encountered treacherous paths, consuming fantasy adventures and grand battles.</p><p>The tales that were told are long to be forgotten, with fans of all ages constantly revisiting the pop-culture phenomenon to reawaken their imagination. While we all know Peter Jackson has a few tricks up his sleeve, LOTR fans shouldn’t get their hopes up for an extension to the universe any time soon. To quench your thirst for Middle-Earth, check out these detailed gifts that will allow you to own a small piece of Middle-Earth. Realistic movie props such as <b>The One Ring</b> and <b>Middle Earth map blankets</b> are available for hobbits of all sizes, just be sure to protect them from Gollum!</p>"

				description: "<p>Star Wars continues to reach new heights as Disney announces a whole host of new series and films set in a galaxy far far away, set to extend the famed cinematic universe over the next decade. Who would have thought that George Lucas’s ambitious 1977 sci-fi thriller would now be considered one of the greatest films franchises ever made. While debates still rage on about which trilogy is best, original, sequels or prequels, all fans can agree that the characters that inhabit the Star Wars universe are extraordinary.</p><p>From villains that kept us awake at night like Darth Vader and and General Grievous, to protagonists that warm our hearts such as R2-D2, Chewbacca, C-3PO and Yoda. The newest sequel trilogy introduced a flurry of new characters like Finn, Kylo Ren and Rey, that captured our childlike wonder, allowing us to fall in love with the Star Wars universe all over again. When it comes to Star Wars merchandise, there isn’t much that compares. Fully-immersive remote <b>controlled droids</b>, <b>stormtrooper costumes</b> and the famous <b>lightsaber</b> are just some of the things in the arsenal for the fans who want to join the resistance!</p>"

While we all still harbour that hope that we’ll receive our letter from Hogwarts in the mail (it probably got lost), fans around the world can’t help but be captivated by the timeless magic.</p><p>We joined Harry, Ron and Hermione on their epic adventures for 8 films, and still wanted more. We shared in the teenage angst, magnificent mythical creatures and sprawling other-worldly landscapes created from the wonderful mind of J.K Rowling. But, it’s the film's small features that were so important to its enchantment and that have translated best into merchandise. In fact, there is so much merchandise, collectibles and replicas that Gringotts vault would do well to hold it all! <b>Chocolate Frogs</b>, <b>Butterbeer</b>, <b>sweets</b>, <b>scarves</b> and <b>jewellery</b> are just some of the exact replicas that fans can own.</p><p><i>The only question left to ask is, what house do you belong in?</i></p>"

Fans all over the world were captivated by the sheer accuracy and immersiveness of the 80s atmosphere, compelling characters and unexpected storylines. The epic adventures experienced by these teen protagonists prompted nostalgic reminders of classic 80s films like The Goonies and The Lost Boys.</p><p>With Netflix suggesting they want to make Stranger Things a billion-dollar brand, fans of the show can expect to enjoy it for many seasons to come. The whole stranger things ambience from the set design, characters and music was almost created with merchandise in mind. The creators fully embraced the classic 80s retro feel that has translated so well to Stranger Things apparel, think polaroid cameras, arcade machines and graphic tees, and films like Ghostbusters and Back to the Future. If you feel like you’re stuck in the upside down waiting for the hotly anticipated season 4, set to air some time in 2021, why not get yourself some Stranger Things merchandise and a piece of future pop-culture history.</p>"
